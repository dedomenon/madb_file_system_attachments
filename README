File System Attachment
======================

Module to store file attachments locally on the server's file system.

To use, install plugin and add these keys in your config/settings.yml file:

  file_attachment_storage: file_system
  file_system_attachments_path: /path/to/directory/to/store/files

If file_system_attachments_path starts with a /, it is an absolute path, else it is a path relative to RAILS_ROOT
